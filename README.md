# RadioactiveDecay

Radioactive Decay is a game I created back in high school. It is a shooter style game, like Galaga, but horizontal projectiles instead of vertical.

About: In the game you are a radioactive subatomic particle, Radon, that is traveling inside the bloodstream. Your goal as a particle is to be shooting radioactive material at the red and white blood cells. However, the white blood cells fight off viruses or anything abnormal in the stream, so it will be shooting anti-oxidants at you. Avoid these, otherwise you die. 

Task: There are two levels. One is the main round that focuses on killing off all the white blood cells. Once you do this, you can advance to the boss round. In this round, you fight the lung. The lung will be sending out all it's white and red blood cells. You must attack the lung until the organ dies.
